create a main.rb file and make a .run file in it
and 
enter a movie
then a enter a movie
and you query the internet from jason

movies table -- many to many ==directors table
genres table -- many to many --movies table

movies: title, year, rated, runtime
directors: name
genre: name

ask for the movie, the data comes out, and you insert the movie into the data base and you pull the directors out and insert them into the directors table 

how do you take the string and turn thm into an array 
director.split
genre.split

make a loop of movie or quit]

save gthem and attach them to that movie 
validate for duplicates of genre's 
genre.where(:name => name) and attach it to the record
as you're pulling the data see if the data exists already using the where and then just attach it
